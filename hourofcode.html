Hour of Code is a process for involvement and engagement of people from different ages to the basics of coding and computer science. Our team 6 named as “Zinvar” hold our event of "Hour of code" at school Modern Innovations Lyceum, our goal in Modern Innovations Lyceum was to cover basics of computer science for 4th and 5th grades with the implementation of many algorithms and programs in Code.org site. Children’s interest to coding astonished us so much that even they could do every step of algorithms without any help. The main goal of Hour of Code is basically demystifying coding and making it more accessible to everybody, establishing background for people who did not experience it before. We created background for 4th   and   5th grade children at coding and computer science
