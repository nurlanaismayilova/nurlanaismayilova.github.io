<article style=" border: #000; border-radius: 2%; border-style:double;
"> Web development involves actual coding and programming for creating the fundamentals of particular websites. It includes the basic structure of the site, numerous functions and operations inside it. The key elements in web creation are based on languages (HTML, CSS or JavaScript), development logic for user interface, and functionality in application. The code editors like Visual Studio Code, IDEs and control systems as Git should be used for implementation of processes by languages mentioned previously. Actually, skills should be mentioned as crucial thing that level of understanding of programming languages is so important for web development frameworks. In summary, web development involves implementation of mark-up and programming languages, website functionality and user interface. Now, after providing to you some information about these languages, let's talk about ouw web-project itself. All of us had fun learning how front-end is structured. How HTML, CSS and JavaScript can be interrelated to each other. The way how by using HTML we can create different tables and blanks and design them by using CSS was very interactive. Also, the way how JavaScript animated (the page "Hour of Code", there is a SlideShow that swaps pages when we push "Pervious Image" or "Next Image") and how it adds changes into the site itself (page "HomeWork3", the "Click me after you finish your journey" bottom changes the sentence itself). The most challenging part was doing JavaScript part because it is the one that we do not see what happens in when we add some command to it. Compared to HTML and CSS it was harder because adding different commands in HTMML and CSS, we saw what happens; however, in JavaScript we were not able to always see what happens when we add commands. Only after we whote the first if in javaPart.js we saw that at least the process starts. After finslizing with if parts, we started to diminish out job by adding new function setImg to add everytime "media/" to the beginning of the file really helped.In addition to fun it was also challengeable for us to do it.</article>
