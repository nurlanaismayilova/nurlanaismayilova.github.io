            <tr><td><article>My name is Nurlana Ismailova, and I study information technology as a SITE student at ADA University. I began my second year at the ADA after finishing the EAPP course at ADA University. I tried to learn HTML before I left my previous institution (School Number 286), I was involved in a java coourse, and the last lessons were about HTML. Since I observed that programmers used programs to create really interesting projects in the ninth grade, I have been fascinated in programming.<br><h4>nismayilova17979@ada.edu.az</h4></article>

I graduated from Modern Innovations Lyceum where we held our "Hour of Code" event. Even though our school didn't teach us anything about programming, I felt proud when I saw children in 4-5-th grades having interest about code.org & programming. I can write codes in Python, C, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. As you see, I love programming. My hobbies are programming, reading books, listening to music, and sometimes drawing sketches and resting my soul with them. One of my goals is graduating with distinction, and I love studying which proofs that I can do it. I believe that I will do my best in ADA University.<br><h4>nasadli19568@ada.edu.az</h4></article>

            <tr><td><article>My name is Ramil. I am currently tracking a major Computer Science at ADA University. Ever since my childhood, I had extreme interest to programming, coding so working as programmer was my dream, and it made me happy to receive an acceptance by ADA University for this study program. I am committed to undertaking all of the requirements for bright and successful graduation and to become professional in my field.
                Beyond academic study, I expected to become socially active in University and I think university environment will be also helpful for me to establish social bonds with many students including international students. I am so optimistic that ADA University will provide the best opportunities for me to achieve these aspirations and to grow in social, personal and academic ways. <br><h4>rzohrabli20069@ada.edu.az</h4>
